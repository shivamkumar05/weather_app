# Weather App README

## Project Overview

Welcome to the Weather App, a Flutter and Dart-based mobile application that provides real-time weather information based on the user's current location. This project showcases the implementation of Bloc state management to efficiently handle and manage the application's state. Additionally, it demonstrates the integration of APIs to retrieve weather data and display various features, including current temperature, maximum and minimum temperature, weather forecast, sunrise time, sunset time, today's date, and current time.

## Features

### 1. Current Temperature
Displays the current temperature at the user's location, providing up-to-date weather information.

### 2. Max Temperature
Shows the maximum temperature for the day, allowing users to plan for the day ahead.

### 3. Min Temperature
Displays the minimum temperature for the day, helping users prepare for cooler periods.

### 4. Weather Forecast
Provides a detailed weather forecast, offering insights into upcoming weather conditions.

### 5. Sunrise Time
Informs users about the time of sunrise, helping them plan activities around daylight.

### 6. Sunset Time
Displays the time of sunset, assisting users in planning evening activities.

### 7. Today's Date
Shows the current date, giving users context for the weather information displayed.

### 8. Current Time
Displays the current time based on the user's device, enhancing the overall user experience.

## Bloc State Management

This project leverages the Bloc state management pattern to efficiently manage the application's state. Bloc helps separate the presentation layer from the business logic, making the codebase more maintainable and scalable. By implementing Bloc, this Weather App achieves a clean and organized structure, ensuring a seamless user experience.

## API Integration

The Weather App utilizes APIs to fetch real-time weather data. Understanding how APIs work, how to make API requests, and handle responses is a key aspect of this project. The integration of API data ensures that the weather information presented is accurate and up-to-date.

## Getting Started

To run the Weather App locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/weather-app.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory.
   ```bash
   cd weather-app
   ```

3. Install dependencies.
   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

4. Run the app.
   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```

Ensure that you have Flutter and Dart installed on your machine before running the app.
